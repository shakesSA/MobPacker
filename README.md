# MobPacker

This is my submission for the problem proposed in the coding challenge

After some research I came to the conclusion that this problem could be solved by the knapsack algorithm approach
I was able to incorporate the solution into my program but there was one scenario that i struggled with, and that is the case where the cost of 2 packages are the same but the lighter package should be selected instead.

I tried various things like sorting my list of packages in order to achieve this but got skewed results.

I created seperate clases to handle the validation of the input record to ensure that it abided by the constraints that were defined.
I also implemnented the APIException as defined in the specification.

I hope this solution is sufficent and would look forward to having a discussion on how I could have improved it as I am always open to learning.

I found this challenge interesting and thank you for the opportunity to present my solution
